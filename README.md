Reflection on Projects


Problem Being Solved:

In the projects for this course, the main problem being solved was to develop a program that could efficiently manage and analyze course data for an academic department. This involved tasks such as loading course data from files, organizing it into data structures, sorting and printing lists of courses, and providing information about specific courses.

Approach to the Problem:

To approach the problem, I first analyzed the requirements and identified the key functionalities needed in the program. Then, I designed data structures such as vectors and structs to represent course information effectively. Understanding data structures was crucial because they allowed for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of course data. For example, using vectors allowed for dynamic storage of course objects, while structs provided a convenient way to encapsulate related data fields.

Overcoming Roadblocks:

Throughout the projects, I encountered various challenges, such as understanding the intricacies of file I/O in C++, implementing sorting algorithms, and handling user input. To overcome these roadblocks, I utilized resources such as documentation, online tutorials, and experimentation. Additionally, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps helped me tackle them more effectively.

Expansion of Approach to Software Design:

Working on these projects expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of modularity, reusability, and scalability. Breaking down the problem into smaller, modular components allowed for easier debugging and maintenance. Moreover, adopting a modular approach facilitated code reuse, as individual functions could be repurposed in different contexts. Understanding data structures and algorithms also enabled me to optimize program performance by selecting appropriate data structures and algorithms for specific tasks.

Evolution of Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs:

Through this project, I have learned the significance of writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By following best practices such as meaningful variable names, clear comments, and modular design, I have improved the readability and maintainability of my programs. Additionally, designing programs with flexibility in mind, such as allowing for easy addition of new features or modifications to existing functionality, has made my code more adaptable to changing requirements and future enhancements. Overall, this project has reinforced the importance of writing clean, well-structured code that is easy to understand and modify.
